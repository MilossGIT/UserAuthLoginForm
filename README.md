## Introduction

The login form is a simple web component designed for user authentication. It is intended to be integrated into web applications that require user login functionality. This form provides a user-friendly interface for entering email and password credentials and includes validation for email format and error messages for incorrect password inputs.

## Features

- User-friendly login form.
- Email validation for proper format.
- Error message for incorrect password.
- Easily customizable to match your application's styling.
- HTML and CSS files included for easy integration.

## Usage

1. Download or clone the repository to your project directory.

2. Include the HTML and CSS files in your web project:
   - `index.html`: This contains the HTML structure for the login form.
   - `styles.css`: This file contains the default styling for the login form. Customize it to match your application's design.

3. Customize the form as needed:
   - You can modify the `styles.css` to match your application's color scheme and styling preferences.
   - To change the labels, placeholders, or error messages, update the relevant HTML elements in `index.html`.

4. Integrate the login form into your application by including it in the desired web page or template.

5. Implement the server-side logic to handle user authentication and form submission. This form provides the user interface only and does not include server-side processing.

## Customization

The login form is designed to be easily customizable. You can customize the form's appearance and behavior by modifying the `styles.css` file to match your application's branding and styling requirements.
